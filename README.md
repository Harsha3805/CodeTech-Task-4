🤖 Machine Learning Model Implementation
🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model using scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes from a dataset. It includes steps for loading data, training a model, and evaluating its performance — for example, detecting spam emails.

🎯 Objective
To apply machine learning techniques using Python and scikit-learn to solve a real-world classification problem and evaluate its performance.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Language: Python

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used:

scikit-learn – for model creation and evaluation

pandas – for data loading and manipulation

matplotlib / seaborn – for data visualization

numpy – for numerical operations

📈 Features
Loads and preprocesses dataset (e.g., email or review data)

Trains a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)

Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall

Visualizes results using plots

Easy to modify for different datasets or model types
